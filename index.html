<h2> Vinit <h2>
<p>A brown man who only knows 2 songs on Rock Band, but every lyric to any T-pain song ever written. A Vinit is typically fun loving and enjoys rapping freestyle. Vinits are commonly referred to as Virgin Slayers and enjoy the finer things in life, such as the number 69 and waking up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy. A technology, glasses-wearing nerd by day and hip, hot deejay by night.
OMG, please get off your computer - you're being such a Vinit.</p>
